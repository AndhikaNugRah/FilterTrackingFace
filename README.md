Integrated Face Tracking & Filter Camera

Objective:

The goal of this project is to develop a system that integrates face tracking capabilities with various image filters, allowing users to apply filters while simultaneously tracking faces in real-time.

Overview:

This project uses OpenCV and Python to create an interactive video processing system. 
The system will employ state-of-the-art face detection algorithms using deep learning models for accurate face tracking.

Key Features:

Real-time face tracking capabilities using OpenCV and deep learning models

Integration with various image filters, including blurring, edge detection, corner detection, and more

User-friendly interface for applying filters and viewing tracked faces in real-time

Design:

The project's design is focused on developing an interactive system that integrates face tracking with image filters.
